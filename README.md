# Coursera_Capstone

Hello everyone. I am a recent graduate with a degree in Business Analytics. 
In the wake of graduating during a pandemic ... it was tough to find a job ... REALLY tough.
I decided to take this series of Data Science courses provided by IBM.
It was supposed to take 6-8 months. I started in October and here I am, just 3 months later, wrapping up the last course.
This is for my Applied Data Science Capstone.
Thank you :)
